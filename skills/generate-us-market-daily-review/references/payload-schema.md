## Market row

```json
{
  "key": "NVDA",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "name": "NVIDIA",
  "open": 0,
  "high": 0,
  "low": 0,
  "close": 0,
  "rth_change": 0,
  "rth_pct": 0,
  "previous_close": 0,
  "day_change": 0,
  "day_pct": 0,
  "volume": 0,
  "bar_count": 78,
  "first_time_et": "YYYY-MM-DDT09:30:00-04:00",
  "last_time_et": "YYYY-MM-DDT15:55:00-04:00",
  "comment": "Source-backed intraday description",
  "source": "https://..."
}
```

Numbers may be `null` only when the row is deliberately retained to show a disclosed gap. Do not use zero for unknown values.

For China rows, use `session_change`, `session_pct`, `first_time_local`, and `last_time_local` instead of the U.S.-specific `rth_*` and `*_time_et` fields. `day_pct` always means previous official close to target-date close. China raw bars use `time_local` with an explicit `+08:00` offset and must fall inside 09:30–11:30 or 13:00–15:00.

Benchmark rows also include `kpi_label`, `kpi_basis`, and `is_proxy`. Always use the short labels `标普500` and `纳斯达克100`. Use `现金指数 · 前收至收盘` for SPX/NDX, or `SPY ETF代理 · 前收至收盘` / `QQQ ETF代理 · 前收至收盘` for fallback rows. Do not put proxy wording in `kpi_label`, and never place IXIC in this field.

## Mover

Extend a market row with:

```json
{
  "driver": "Verified event and cautious interpretation",
  "category": "财报/指引",
  "source": "https://..."
}
```

Sort by absolute `day_pct` or explained market importance. A mover with missing prices should normally be excluded; retain only when the missing price itself is clearly disclosed and the report still meets quality standards.

## Market-news item

Preferred object shape:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "source_time": "AP：YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC",
  "fact": "[事实] ...",
  "inference": "[推断] 市场可能解读为...",
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

The renderer also accepts the legacy list shape `[title, source_time, fact, inference, url]`.

## Global-news item

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "region": "...",
  "source_time": "...",
  "summary": "...",
  "importance": "...",
  "impact": "...",
  "impact_score": 4,
  "impact_type": "能源/地缘",
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

The renderer also accepts `[title, region, source_time, summary, importance, impact, impact_score, impact_type, url]`.

## Important-person item

```json
{
  "person": "黄仁勋",
  "title": "NVIDIA创始人兼首席执行官",
  "title_source_text": "founder and CEO of NVIDIA",
  "time_platform": "YYYY-MM-DD；LinkedIn",
  "platform": "LinkedIn",
  "quote": "Short verified excerpt or clearly labeled paraphrase",
  "context": "Why it matters and verification boundary",
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

`person` contains the name only. `title` and `title_source_text` are optional as a pair: include them only when `url` points to the inspected original source that explicitly states the title. `title_source_text` preserves the exact source wording for audit and is not rendered. If no source-backed title is available, omit both and the page displays only the name. Do not add `comments` or `comment_url`.

Legacy lists in the old shape `[person, time_platform, platform, quote, context, comments, url, comment_url]` remain readable for migration, but their comment fields are discarded and any role embedded in `person` is suppressed unless it is resupplied through the source-backed fields above.

## Next-watch item

```json
{
  "time": "08:30 ET",
  "title": "U.S. CPI",
  "detail": "What is confirmed and which assets may react",
  "source_label": "BLS official",
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

If no reliable URL exists for a proposed schedule, use a visible `暂无可靠来源确认` item and omit invented timing.

## Raw series file shape

The bundled TradingView fetcher writes:

```json
{
  "source": "TradingView anonymous chart websocket",
  "resolution": "5",
  "report_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "symbols": {
    "NVDA": {
      "tradingview_symbol": "NASDAQ:NVDA",
      "summary": {"open": 0, "high": 0, "low": 0, "close": 0},
      "bars": [
        {"time_et": "YYYY-MM-DDT09:30:00-04:00", "open": 0, "high": 0, "low": 0, "close": 0, "volume": 0}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`series_files` can point to multiple retry/mover files. Later files override the same symbol key only when they contain a non-empty series.

The Sina China adapter uses the same top-level `symbols` map, with `time_local` bars and `summary.day_change_pct`. It may also include `sectors`, `movers`, `mover_filter`, `watchlist`, `latest_market_date_seen`, and `warnings`. `watchlist` preserves the effective ordered sectors/stocks and its source without an absolute user path. A historical request must not reuse a later ranking/sector snapshot.
